Pi-hole on Fly.io served via Tailscale
======================================

How to do it:

  1. [Get set up with Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/) (only install `flyctl` and create an account/login)
  1. [Get set up with Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install/)
  1. Clone this repo
  1. Run the command `fly launch --name $APP_NAME --no-deploy` and answer the prompts (pick your own $APP_NAME)
  1. [Create an auth key in Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/) and copy it to clipboard
  1. Run the command `fly secrets set TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY=<paste auth key here>`
  1. Run the command `fly secrets set WEBPASSWORD=<admin interface password here>`
  1. Run the command `fly deploy --remote-only`
  1. Test it out with `dig @${APP_NAME}.fly.dev google.com`
  1. If $STEP-1 worked, navigate to the [Tailscale admin interface](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines), grab the IP of your instance, then navigate to the "DNS" tab and add the IP as a 
nameserver. Make sure to activate "Override local DNS" in order to be able to use it on iOS and not have to configure the nameservers manually on every device.
